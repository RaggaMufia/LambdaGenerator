# LambdaGenerator
An prolog implementation of DCG to generate lambda terms from given alphabet works together with C program that validate the output.

# Compiling (C)
gcc -o teste main.c

# Running
> C: ./teste

> Prolog: Open the 'll1.pl' file and run the clause "run".

# Cautions 
* The prolog's generated output file has huge size. (Above 16 GB)
